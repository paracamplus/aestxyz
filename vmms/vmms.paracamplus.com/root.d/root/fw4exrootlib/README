                FW4EX scripts for root on VM

These scripts will be available within the VM in the
~root/fw4exrootlib/ directory. They are intended to be used only by
root since they require very special rights (create user, change
rights).

In case of errors, their exit code lies above 50.

commonLib.sh
        contain the main parameters for all these scripts.

# determine the EXERCISEID, fetch the associated exercise.tgz
# determine the JOBID.

available-author.sh EXERCISEID JOBID
        echo the userName of an available account ready to serve as 
        an author of an exercise.
# NOTA: JOBID is not really necessary but useful for debug.

# now, AUTHOR is known, transfer the exercise.tgz 

deploy-exercise.sh AUTHOR EXERCISEID EXERCISETGZ
        deploy an exercise in the author's account.

initialize-exercise.sh AUTHOR EXERCISEID
        initialize an exercise: the tgz is inflated in the author's account, 
        the fw4ex.xml descriptor is compiled a first time to get the bash 
        script to factorize stuff common to all markings. The fw4ex.xml
        descriptor is compiled a second time in order to get the grading 
        script to mark student's files. These compilers are:

exercise-xml2sh-init.pl
        compile an fw4ex.xml descriptor into the bash script to initialize
        an exercise.

exercise-xml2sh.pl
        compile an fw4ex.xml descriptor into the grading script.

# These scripts are stored in EXERCISE_CACHE_DIR/$EXERCISEID/
# the exercise is now ready.
# NOTA: a single script install-exercise.sh EXERCISEID EXERCISETGZ 
# should take care of the three previous scripts!

available-student.sh JOBID
        echo the userName of an available account ready to serve as
        a student.

# now, STUDENT is known, transfer the job.tgz
# and deploy it with ../fw4exlib/deploy-job.sh JOBTGZ
# ran from the student's account. This is an unprivileged account.

mark-student.sh STUDENT JOBID AUTHOR EXERCISEID
        mark the files of one student.
# NOTA: same for exercises, the two previous scripts should be merged into
# a single one: install-and-mark-student.sh JOBID JOBTGZ AUTHOR EXERCISEID

# The following script is used when marking the student's files

confine-author.sh
        limit the resources an author may consume.

# After marking, get the report (as a .tgz)

clean-student.sh STUDENT JOBID
        remove a job after marking.

clean-exercise.sh EXERCISEID JOBID
        remove an exercise unless the cache parameter is set; in that case,
        the real work is done by clear-cached-exercises.sh

# When the cache of exercises is in action:

clean-old-exercises.sh 
        ran via crontab to purge cached and useless deployed exercises.



# I don't know why the two following scripts are there ???

clean-unused-exercises.sh

clear-cached-exercises.sh 

# Given the notes, we can reduce the interactions with the VM to:
#   scp exercise.tgz root@vm:EXERCISETGZ
#   install-exercise.sh EXERCISEID EXERCISETGZ
#   scp student.tgz root@vm:JOBTGZ
#   install-and-mark-student.sh JOBID JOBTGZ EXERCISEID
#   scp root@vm:JOBRESULTTGZ .
#   clean-student.sh JOBID
#   clean-exercise.sh EXERCISEID
#   state.sh     # returns the state of the vm.
#   get-log.sh    

# or as a protocol
#   fw4exd-client install-exercise EXERCISEID < EXERCISETGZ (shar mode ?)


#end.
